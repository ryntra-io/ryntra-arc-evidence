/**
 * Canonical, domain-separated hashing for the Arc Treasury Payout records.
 *
 * This is deliberately a *second* helper rather than a change to
 * `hashCanonical`. The existing helper hashes `JSON.stringify(canonical(value))`
 * with no domain prefix, and every intent, authorization, execution and receipt
 * vector in the repository is pinned to those exact bytes. Adding a prefix there
 * would silently rewrite all of them, so the payout records get their own
 * function and the legacy bytes stay untouched — the compatibility rule this
 * task is built on.
 *
 * ## Exact encoding
 *
 * ```text
 * hash = "0x" + hex( SHA-256( UTF-8( domain + "\n" + canonicalJson(payload) ) ) )
 * ```
 *
 * - **Domain** is one of {@link PAYOUT_HASH_DOMAINS}, terminated by a single
 *   `\n`. The separator is a byte that cannot appear in a domain label, so no
 *   two distinct (domain, payload) pairs can collide by concatenation.
 * - **Key ordering** is ascending UTF-16 code-unit order at every object depth,
 *   using the same comparator the legacy helper uses, so two implementations of
 *   the same record cannot disagree because of locale.
 * - **`undefined` members are dropped; `null` is preserved.** A field that is
 *   explicitly "no value" is part of the record; a field nobody set is not.
 * - **Arrays keep their given order.** Callers that need order independence
 *   sort before hashing — {@link payoutApprovalSetHash} is the one place that
 *   matters, and it sorts explicitly rather than trusting insertion order.
 * - **Numbers must be finite.** Money never travels as a JavaScript number in
 *   these records; it travels as a decimal string plus an integer base-unit
 *   string, both normalized before hashing.
 * - **Output** is lowercase hex with a `0x` prefix.
